- Layers Panel: Organize designs with separate layers for sketches, colors, and details
- Swatches Panel: Build custom fashion color palettes
- Symbols Panel: Store frequently used design elements

### Fashion Design Grids and Guides

**Setting Up Fashion Figure Proportions:**
- Standard fashion figure: 9-10 heads tall (elongated from realistic 7-8 heads)
- Head: 1 unit (measurement reference)
- Neck to bust: 1 head length
- Bust to waist: 1 head length  
- Waist to hip: 1 head length
- Hip to knee: 2 head lengths
- Knee to ankle: 2 head lengths

**Creating Reusable Templates:**
- Save template files with guides and basic figure proportions
- Include standard measurement guides for garment proportions
- Set up color swatches for seasonal palettes
- Create symbol libraries for common design elements

### Student Exercise:
Create a fashion design template with proper proportions and guides. Practice drawing basic fashion figures using the 9-head proportion system.

## Module 3.2: Technical Flat Drawing (Technical Sketches)

### What are Technical Flats?

Technical flats are precise, proportional drawings of garments shown without a human figure. They focus on construction details, seam lines, and design elements rather than artistic interpretation.

**Purpose of Technical Flats:**
- Communicate design details to pattern makers
- Show construction and stitching details clearly
- Provide specifications for manufacturing
- Create consistent design documentation

### Drawing Basic Garment Shapes

**Basic Bodice Construction:**
- Start with a rectangle representing the torso
- Add armholes using smooth curves
- Include neckline shape and depth
- Mark shoulder seam placement
- Add side seams with appropriate ease

**Basic Skirt Shapes:**
- A-line: Flares gradually from waist to hem
- Pencil: Straight and fitted through hips
- Circle: Full circle requires 2x waist measurement radius
- Gathered: Shows gather marks at waistline

**Basic Sleeve Types:**
- Set-in sleeve: Curved at shoulder, fitted at wrist
- Raglan sleeve: Seam line from underarm to neckline
- Kimono sleeve: Cut in one piece with bodice
- Cap sleeve: Short sleeve that covers only shoulder

### Technical Drawing Techniques

**Line Weights for Technical Flats:**
- Outer silhouette: 2-3pt stroke weight (thickest)
- Construction seams: 1-2pt stroke weight (medium)
- Topstitching and details: 0.5-1pt stroke weight (thinnest)
- Hidden construction: Dashed lines, 1pt weight

**Showing Design Details:**
- Darts: Show as triangular shapes with stitching lines
- Pleats: Indicate fold direction with arrows or fold lines
- Pockets: Show pocket bags with dashed lines if hidden
- Closures: Indicate zipper placement, button spacing

**Technical Flat Proportions:**
- Maintain realistic proportions (not fashion figure proportions)
- Show garments as they would actually fit on the body
- Include appropriate ease in silhouette
- Ensure symmetry in design elements

### Common Student Questions:

**Q: "Should technical flats be as stylized as fashion illustrations?"**
A: No, technical flats should be accurate and proportional to real body measurements. They're working drawings, not artistic interpretations.

**Q: "How do I show a curved seam accurately?"**
A: Use the Pen Tool to create smooth curves. Practice with the Anchor Point Tool to adjust curve handles for natural-looking seam lines.

## Module 3.3: Working with Fashion Colors and Prints

### Building Fashion Color Palettes

**Understanding Color Theory for Fashion:**
- Monochromatic: Different shades/tints of one color
- Analogous: Colors next to each other on color wheel
- Complementary: Colors opposite on color wheel
- Triadic: Three colors equally spaced on color wheel

**Creating Seasonal Palettes:**
- Spring: Light, warm colors (coral, mint, sunshine yellow)
- Summer: Cool, muted colors (navy, lavender, soft pink)
- Fall: Rich, warm colors (burgundy, mustard, forest green)
- Winter: Deep, cool colors (black, royal blue, emerald)

**Fashion Color Standards:**
- Pantone Fashion Color System: Industry standard for color communication
- CMYK values: For print production and tech packs
- RGB values: For digital presentations and websites
- Color matching: Ensure consistency across different materials

### Creating Textile Patterns

**Basic Repeat Patterns:**
- Straight repeat: Pattern elements align in regular grid
- Half-drop repeat: Every other row drops down by half the pattern height
- Brick repeat: Pattern elements offset like bricks in a wall
- Random repeat: Pattern elements placed without obvious structure

**Pattern Creation Workflow:**
1. Design individual motifs (flowers, geometric shapes, etc.)
2. Arrange motifs in repeat structure
3. Create seamless edges using Pattern Options
4. Test repeat by creating swatches
5. Apply to garment shapes for visualization

**Technical Pattern Requirements:**
- Seamless edges: Pattern must connect perfectly at edges
- Appropriate scale: Consider garment size and wearing distance
- Color registration: Ensure colors align properly in print production
- File preparation: Save as patterns swatches for easy application

### Fabric Rendering Techniques

**Showing Different Fabric Types:**
- Cotton: Clean lines, minimal texture indication
- Silk: Add subtle highlight and shadow for luminosity  
- Wool: Slightly rougher texture, matte finish
- Leather: Strong highlights and deep shadows
- Denim: Show topstitching and subtle texture lines

**Rendering Techniques:**
- Gradients: Use subtle gradients to show fabric drape
- Transparency: Show layering effects with opacity changes
- Texture brushes: Create custom brushes for fabric textures
- Lighting effects: Use highlights and shadows to show dimension

### Student Practice Exercises:

1. **Color Palette Creation:** Build a 6-color seasonal palette using proper color theory principles
2. **Simple Pattern Design:** Create a small floral motif and turn it into a seamless repeat pattern
3. **Fabric Rendering:** Practice rendering the same garment in 3 different fabric types

## Module 3.4: Fashion Presentation and Portfolio Layouts

### Professional Presentation Standards
