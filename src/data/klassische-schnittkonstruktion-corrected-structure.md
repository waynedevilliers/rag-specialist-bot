- Work with right side of skirt (pattern symmetry principles)
- Use pattern weights to secure paper during construction
- Maintain clean, organized workspace throughout process

**Construction Sequence - Back Section:**

**Back Center Line Establishment:**
- Draw straight line 3-4cm from paper edge (avoid irregular edges)
- Verify line is minimum 70cm long for adequate pattern length
- Mark as "HM" (Hintere Mitte - Back Center)
- This serves as primary construction reference line

**Horizontal Construction Lines:**
- Waistline: Draw perpendicular to back center, exact 90-degree angle
- Use grid markings on Japanese ruler for precise right angles
- Hip line: Measure hip depth (20cm standard) down from waistline
- Draw perpendicular line at hip depth measurement
- Hem line: Measure total skirt length (60cm) from waistline
- Draw perpendicular line at hem measurement

**Back Width Calculation:**
- Use finished hip circumference measurement from table
- Divide by 4 (quarter pattern construction)
- Standard measurement: 25.5cm from center to side seam
- Mark this distance on hip line, waistline, and hem line
- Draw side seam line connecting these three points

**Construction Sequence - Front Section:**

**Front Section Placement:**
- Leave 5cm space between back and front sections
- This spacing allows for later pattern separation and checking
- Extend horizontal lines (waist, hip, hem) from back section
- Use same width calculation as back section (25.25cm standard)

**Front Center Line:**
- Measure quarter hip circumference from front side seam
- Draw perpendicular line from hip line through waist and hem
- Mark as "VM" (Vordere Mitte - Front Center)
- Verify all measurements match back section dimensions

**Quality Control Standards:**
- All lines must be straight and perpendicular
- Hip line measurements must match exactly front and back
- Side seam measurements must be consistent
- Pattern pieces properly spaced for later manipulation
- Clear marking and identification of all construction lines

**Professional Foundation:**
This Teil establishes the basic rectangular framework that serves as the foundation for all subsequent pattern development. Accuracy at this stage is critical for proper fit in the finished garment.
