# Pattern Making Fundamentals - Course 101

## Module 1.1: Introduction to Pattern Making

### What is Pattern Making?
Pattern making is the art and science of creating templates used to cut fabric pieces for garments. A pattern is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional garment, broken down into individual pieces that will be sewn together.

### Types of Patterns

**Commercial Patterns:**
- Mass-produced patterns sold to home sewers
- Available in standard size ranges
- Include instruction sheets and cutting layouts
- Examples: Simplicity, McCall's, Vogue patterns

**Custom Patterns:**
- Created for specific measurements
- Made for individual clients or fit models
- Used in haute couture and bespoke tailoring
- Require advanced pattern making skills

**Block Patterns (Slopers):**
- Basic fitted patterns without design details
- Used as foundation for creating new designs
- Include basic bodice, sleeve, skirt, and trouser blocks
- Essential tool for professional pattern makers

### Essential Pattern Making Tools

**Measuring Tools:**
- Tape measure (flexible, preferably with both imperial and metric)
- Clear plastic rulers (18" and 24")
- French curve rulers for smooth curved lines
- Hip curve (vary form curve) for armholes and necklines

**Drawing Tools:**
- Pattern paper (dot and cross paper, manila tag board)
- Pencils (2H for light lines, HB for marking)
- Red pen for corrections and alterations
- Awl or tracing wheel for transferring markings

**Cutting Tools:**
- Sharp paper scissors (dedicated to paper only)
- Rotary cutter and cutting mat
- Pattern weights (instead of pins on delicate papers)

### Common Student Questions:

**Q: "What's the difference between a pattern and a block?"**
A: A block (or sloper) is a basic fitted pattern without design details, style lines, or seam allowances. It's used as a foundation. A pattern includes design details, style lines, and seam allowances ready for cutting fabric.

**Q: "Why can't I just trace around an existing garment?"**
A: Tracing around garments doesn't account for seam allowances, doesn't provide proper grain lines, and doesn't show how the three-dimensional garment breaks down into flat pattern pieces.

## Module 1.2: Taking Accurate Measurements

### Body Measurement Fundamentals

**Preparation for Measuring:**
- Wear fitted undergarments or form-fitting clothes
- Stand in natural posture with weight evenly distributed
- Use a non-stretchy tape measure
- Record measurements immediately to avoid errors

### Key Measurements for Women's Patterns

**Horizontal Measurements:**
- Bust: Around the fullest part of the chest, keeping tape level
- Waist: At the natural waistline (narrowest part of torso)
- Hip: Around the fullest part of the hips (usually 7-9" below waist)
- Back width: Across the back from arm fold to arm fold

**Vertical Measurements:**
- Center front length: From base of neck to waist
- Center back length: From prominent neck bone to waist
- Shoulder length: From base of neck to shoulder point
- Full length: From shoulder to desired hemline

**Circumference Measurements:**
- Neck: Around the base of the neck
- Upper arm: Around the fullest part of the arm
- Wrist: Around the wrist bone
- Thigh: Around the fullest part of the thigh

### Measurement Recording Tips

**Documentation:**
- Create a measurement chart for each person
- Include date of measurement (bodies change over time)
- Note any fitting preferences (likes loose/fitted garments)
- Record both actual measurements and ease added

**Common Measurement Mistakes:**
- Tape too tight or too loose
- Tape not level around circumference measurements
- Not measuring over appropriate undergarments
- Forgetting to record measurements immediately

### Student Practice Exercise:
Take measurements of yourself or a friend, recording all key measurements listed above. Compare your measurements to standard pattern sizing charts to understand how commercial patterns might fit.

## Module 1.3: Understanding Ease

### What is Ease?

Ease is the difference between body measurements and the finished garment measurements. It allows for movement, comfort, and creates the desired silhouette.

### Types of Ease

**Wearing Ease (Functional Ease):**
The minimum amount of ease needed for basic body movement and comfort.

Standard Wearing Ease Amounts:
- Bust: 2-4 inches (closer fitting styles use less)
- Waist: 1-2 inches  
- Hip: 2-3 inches
- Upper arm: 1.5-2 inches

**Design Ease (Style Ease):**
Additional ease beyond wearing ease that creates the desired style and silhouette.

Design Ease Categories:
- Close-fitting: 0-2 inches additional ease
- Fitted: 2-4 inches additional ease  
- Semi-fitted: 4-6 inches additional ease
- Loose-fitting: 6+ inches additional ease

### Ease Distribution

**How Ease is Distributed:**
- Front and back pieces typically share ease equally
- Side seams usually get the most ease adjustment
- Darts help shape ease around body curves
- Some ease may be taken up in seam allowances

**Fabric Considerations:**
- Woven fabrics need more ease than knits
- Stretch fabrics can use negative ease (smaller than body measurements)
- Bulky fabrics require additional ease for layering
- Crisp fabrics hold their shape better with more ease

### Common Student Questions:

**Q: "How do I know how much ease to add?"**
A: Start with standard wearing ease amounts, then add design ease based on the desired fit. Look at similar garments you own and like the fit of for reference.

**Q: "Why does my finished garment feel tight even though I added ease?"**
A: Common causes include: insufficient ease for your body type, ease lost in seaming, fabric with less drape than expected, or incorrect measurement taking.

**Q: "Can I have too much ease?"**
A: Yes, too much ease can create unflattering fits, excess fabric that doesn't drape well, and garments that look sloppy rather than stylish.

## Module 1.4: Seam Allowances and Pattern Markings

### Seam Allowances

**Standard Seam Allowance Amounts:**
- 5/8" (15mm): Most common for garment construction
- 1/2" (12mm): Used for fitted garments or lightweight fabrics
- 1/4" (6mm): Used for curved seams, facings, or when bulk is a concern
- 1" (25mm): Used for hemlines and areas that may need adjustment

**When to Use Different Amounts:**
- Curved seams (necklines, armholes): 1/4" to 3/8"
- Straight seams (side seams, shoulder seams): 5/8"
- Center back seams: 3/4" to 1" for fitting adjustments
- Hemlines: 1" to 4" depending on garment style

### Essential Pattern Markings

**Grainline Arrows:**
- Indicate how pattern pieces should be placed on fabric
- Usually parallel to selvedge edge
- Critical for proper drape and fit
- Double-headed arrows show straight grain

**Notches:**
- Triangle-shaped marks that help match seam lines
- Single notches typically mark front pieces
- Double notches typically mark back pieces
- Help align curved seams correctly

**Darts:**
- Triangular areas that shape flat fabric to fit body curves
- Marked with solid lines and stitching lines
- Include dart point and dart legs
- Essential for proper fit around bust, waist, and hips

**Fold Lines:**
- Indicate where fabric should be folded
- Used for facings, hems, and design details
- Often marked with "fold" text on pattern
- May be indicated with dash-dot lines

**Placement Lines:**
- Show where pockets, buttons, or trim should be placed
- Help ensure symmetrical placement
- Include measurements from pattern edges
- Critical for professional-looking results

### Pattern Symbols Reference

**Line Types:**
- Solid lines: Cutting lines
- Dashed lines: Fold lines or hidden construction details
- Dash-dot lines: Center front/back lines
- Dotted lines: Stitching lines or placement guides

**Geometric Symbols:**
- Circles: Button or snap placement
- Squares: Pocket corners or construction points
- Diamonds: Pattern matching points
- Triangles: Notches for seam matching

### Student Troubleshooting:

**Problem:** "My seams don't match up when I try to sew them together."
**Solution:** Check that you've matched notches correctly and that you're sewing with consistent seam allowances. Use a seam gauge to ensure accuracy.

**Problem:** "My garment looks twisted or pulls in strange directions."
**Solution:** Verify that all pieces were cut on the correct grainline. Fabric cut off-grain will not hang or drape properly.

**Problem:** "I can't figure out which piece goes where."
**Solution:** Pattern pieces should be labeled clearly. Match notches and refer to instruction diagrams. Single notches typically indicate front pieces, double notches indicate back pieces.
