# Fashion Construction Methods - Course 401

## Module 4.1: Professional Sewing Techniques

### Seam Types and Applications

**Plain Seam (5/8" Standard):**
Most common seam in garment construction
- Use: General construction, side seams, shoulder seams
- Construction: Right sides together, stitch 5/8" from edge
- Finishing: Serge, pink, or bind edges to prevent fraying
- Press: Usually toward back or less visible side

**French Seam:**
Fully enclosed seam with no raw edges
- Use: Lightweight fabrics, unlined garments, luxury construction
- Construction: Wrong sides together first, then right sides together
- First seam: 3/8" from edge, trim to 1/8"
- Second seam: 1/4" from edge, enclosing raw edges
- Press: To one side, creates clean interior finish

**Flat Fell Seam:**
Strong, decorative seam with visible topstitching
- Use: Jeans, shirts, sportswear, men's tailoring
- Construction: One seam allowance trimmed shorter than other
- Longer allowance wraps around shorter allowance
- Topstitch through all layers for strong, flat seam
- Press: Usually toward back of garment

**Bound Seam:**
Seam allowances enclosed in bias binding
- Use: Unlined jackets, couture construction, bulky fabrics
- Construction: Sew normal seam, then bind edges together
- Binding: Use purchased bias tape or self-made binding
- Results in clean, professional interior finish

### Dart Construction and Variations

**Standard Bust Dart:**
- Mark dart legs and point accurately from pattern
- Stitch from wide end toward point
- Do not backstitch at dart point (causes dimpling)
- Press toward center front (or as pattern indicates)
- Trim dart excess if fabric is bulky

**Waist Darts:**
- Usually pressed toward center front or back
- Can be curved for better fit over hip curve
- May be converted to seam lines in princess styles
- Important for creating fitted waistline silhouette

**Contour Darts (Double-pointed):**
- Darts that are wide in middle, narrow at both ends
- Used to shape fabric over curves (bust to waist)
- Require careful marking and stitching
- Clip at widest point if necessary for pressing

### Advanced Construction Details

**Setting Sleeves:**
- Ease sleeve cap evenly around armhole
- Match notches and key construction points
- Use small stitches to control ease distribution
- Press seam allowances toward sleeve or body as designed

**Installing Zippers:**
- Invisible zipper: Sewn before side seam is closed
- Lapped zipper: One side overlaps the other
- Centered zipper: Equal distance from zipper on both sides
- All zippers require proper length and careful placement

**Collar Construction:**
- Under collar slightly smaller than upper collar
- Grade seam allowances to reduce bulk
- Understitch facing to prevent rolling
- Press carefully to maintain proper shape and roll line

## Module 4.2: Fitting and Alterations

### Common Fitting Issues

**Bodice Fitting Problems:**

*Horizontal Wrinkles:*
- Cause: Too much length in bodice
- Solution: Shorten bodice at waist or add waist seam
- Take out excess length evenly across bodice width

*Vertical Wrinkles:*
- Cause: Too much width in bodice  
- Solution: Take in side seams or add darts
- Remove excess fabric gradually to maintain balance

*Pulling Across Bust:*
- Cause: Insufficient bust room or dart placement
- Solution: Let out side seams, adjust dart position
- May need to add bust dart or increase dart size

*Gaping at Neckline:*
- Cause: Neckline too large or shoulders too wide
- Solution: Take in shoulder seams, adjust neckline curve
- May need to reshape entire neckline area

### Sleeve Fitting Adjustments

**Sleeve Length:**
- Measure from shoulder point to desired length
- Adjust at hem or at elbow if fitted sleeve
- Consider proportion to overall garment length

**Sleeve Width:**
- Adjust underarm seam for width changes
- Maintain armhole circumference for proper fit
- Taper changes gradually from armhole to hem

**Sleeve Cap Issues:**
- Too much ease: Remove excess ease evenly
- Too little ease: Add ease or reshape armhole
- Wrinkles in cap: Adjust ease distribution

### Pattern Alterations

**Lengthening/Shortening:**
- Use designated alteration lines on patterns
- Maintain pattern proportions when making changes
- Adjust related pattern pieces (facings, linings)

**Width Adjustments:**
- Grade changes gradually across pattern width
- Maintain side seam angles and curves
- Adjust armhole and neckline curves if needed

**Full Bust Adjustment (FBA):**
- Add width and length to accommodate larger bust
- Pivot dart to maintain fit while adding room
- Complex alteration requiring careful measurement

## Module 4.3: Professional Finishing Techniques

### Edge Finishing Methods

**Bias Binding:**
- Cut true bias strips 4 times finished width
- Join strips with diagonal seams to reduce bulk
- Apply with even pressure, maintaining edge smoothness
- Miter corners for professional appearance

**Facings:**
- Interface facing pieces for stability
- Grade seam allowances to reduce bulk
- Understitch to prevent facing from rolling out
- Catchstitch facing to seam allowances only

**Hong Kong Finish:**
- Luxury edge finish using bias strips
- Encloses raw edges completely
- Time-intensive but creates beautiful interior
- Often used in high-end unlined garments

### Pressing Techniques

**Basic Pressing Rules:**
- Use appropriate heat setting for fabric
- Use press cloth for delicate fabrics
- Press seams flat first, then press open or to side
- Never drag iron across fabric (causes stretching)

**Pressing Equipment:**
- Steam iron with variable heat settings
- Press cloth (silk organza or cotton)
- Seam roll for pressing curved seams
- Ham for pressing shaped areas (bust, hip curves)
- Point turner for sharp corners and points

**Specialized Pressing:**
- Darts: Press over ham to maintain body curves
- Curved seams: Press over seam roll
- Corners and points: Use point turner, press carefully
- Interfaced areas: Use press cloth, moderate heat

### Quality Control Standards

**Professional Construction Checkpoints:**
- All seams straight and even width
- Pattern matching at seams (plaids, stripes)
- Consistent topstitching distance from edges
- Buttonholes properly sized and positioned
- Hems even and invisible from right side

**Final Garment Inspection:**
- Check all construction details before final pressing
- Verify proper fit and hang of garment
- Ensure all threads are trimmed and secure
- Test all closures (zippers, buttons, snaps)
- Steam or press garment for professional appearance

## Module 4.4: Troubleshooting Construction Problems

### Common Sewing Machine Issues

**Skipped Stitches:**
- Cause: Wrong needle type, bent needle, incorrect threading
- Solution: Replace needle, rethread machine, check needle type for fabric
- Use appropriate needles: universal, ballpoint, denim, etc.

**Thread Breaking:**
- Cause: Thread tension too tight, poor quality thread, wrong needle
- Solution: Adjust tension, use quality thread, replace needle
- Check thread path through machine guides

**Uneven Stitching:**
- Cause: Inconsistent speed, fabric not feeding properly
- Solution: Maintain steady speed, guide fabric gently
- Check presser foot pressure and feed dog condition

### Fabric-Specific Construction Issues

**Slippery Fabrics (Silk, Satin):**
- Use fine pins and needles to prevent damage
- Consider tissue paper under fabric for stability
- Use appropriate presser foot (walking foot)
- Cut with sharp scissors to prevent fraying

**Stretch Fabrics (Knits, Jersey):**
- Use ballpoint needles designed for knits
- Use appropriate stitches (zigzag, stretch stitches)
- Don't stretch fabric while sewing
- Consider using a walking foot or stretch foot

**Bulky Fabrics (Wool, Coating):**
- Use heavy-duty needles and strong thread
- Increase stitch length for better penetration
- Consider reducing bulk in seam allowances
- Use appropriate pressing techniques

### Student Practice Scenarios:

**Scenario 1:** Student's sleeve doesn't fit properly in armhole
- Check measurements against pattern
- Verify correct ease distribution
- Ensure proper seam allowances were used
- Consider armhole and sleeve cap adjustments

**Scenario 2:** Neckline gapes and doesn't lie flat
- Measure against original pattern specifications
- Check shoulder seam placement and length
- Consider neckline reshaping or dart adjustments
- Verify correct interfacing application

**Scenario 3:** Side seams are uneven lengths
- Check cutting accuracy against pattern
- Verify seam allowance consistency
- Consider pattern layout on fabric grain
- Adjust seam lengths before final construction
