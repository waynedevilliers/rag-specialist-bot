    docType: "api" | "guide" | "reference",
    version: string
  }
}
```

## Knowledge Base Content Strategy

### Primary Sources:
1. **Next.js Documentation:**
   - App Router guide
   - API Routes
   - Server Components
   - Client Components
   - Routing and Navigation

2. **React Documentation:**
   - Component patterns
