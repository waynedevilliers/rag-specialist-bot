# Security Review Checklist

## Overview
This checklist ensures comprehensive security review of all code changes in the RAG Fashion Assistant system.

## Pre-Commit Security Review

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Vector dimensions and values are bounded
- [ ] Query length limits are enforced
- [ ] File path validation prevents traversal attacks
- [ ] API parameters are validated before use

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] API keys are properly validated and secured
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Environment variables are properly handled
- [ ] Access controls are implemented where needed

### Data Security & Privacy
- [ ] Sensitive data is not logged or cached inappropriately
- [ ] localStorage usage is secure and limited
- [ ] Vector data doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Cache keys are not predictable
- [ ] TTL and cleanup mechanisms are secure

### Memory Safety
- [ ] Buffer operations have bounds checking
- [ ] Mathematical operations check for overflow/underflow
- [ ] Memory allocation has reasonable limits
- [ ] No memory leaks in caching systems
- [ ] Vector operations are numerically stable

### API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internal details
- [ ] External API calls are secure
- [ ] Request/response validation is present
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities (prompt, NoSQL, etc.)

### Algorithmic Security
- [ ] No algorithmic complexity attacks possible
- [ ] Search parameters are bounded
- [ ] Parallel operations are thread-safe
- [ ] No timing side-channel vulnerabilities
- [ ] Cache behavior doesn't leak information

### Error Handling
- [ ] Errors don't expose stack traces to users
- [ ] Security-relevant errors are logged
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms are secure
- [ ] No information disclosure through errors

## Security Risk Levels

### HIGH RISK ðŸ”´
- API key exposure
- Prompt injection vulnerabilities
- Cache poisoning attacks
- Memory exhaustion attacks
- Path traversal vulnerabilities

### MEDIUM RISK ðŸŸ¡
- Information disclosure
- Race conditions
- Mathematical precision attacks
- Regular expression DoS
- Timing attacks

### LOW RISK ðŸŸ¢
- Minor information leakage
- Configuration hardening
- Logging improvements
- Performance optimizations with minimal security impact

## Post-Review Actions

### For HIGH RISK Issues
1. **STOP** - Do not deploy until fixed
2. Create immediate fix
3. Add regression tests
4. Update security documentation
5. Consider if similar issues exist elsewhere

### For MEDIUM RISK Issues
1. Create fix within current sprint
2. Add monitoring/detection
3. Document workarounds if needed
4. Plan remediation timeline

### For LOW RISK Issues
1. Add to technical debt backlog
2. Fix during next maintenance cycle
3. Document acceptable risk level

## Security Testing Requirements

### Static Analysis
- [ ] Code scanned for common vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies checked for known CVEs
- [ ] Configuration reviewed for security issues

### Dynamic Testing
- [ ] Input fuzzing on vector operations
- [ ] Rate limiting tests
- [ ] Cache poisoning attempts
- [ ] Error handling validation

### Integration Testing
- [ ] API security tested end-to-end
- [ ] Authentication flows verified
- [ ] Data flow security validated

## Incident Response

### If Vulnerability Found in Production
1. **Assess severity** using risk levels above
2. **Contain**: Implement temporary mitigations
3. **Fix**: Deploy security patch
4. **Monitor**: Check for exploitation attempts
5. **Learn**: Update checklist and processes

## Security Review Sign-off

- [ ] **Static Analysis**: All automated checks pass
- [ ] **Manual Review**: Code manually reviewed by security-focused agent
- [ ] **Testing**: Security tests pass
- [ ] **Documentation**: Security implications documented
- [ ] **Approval**: Security review complete and approved
