# RAG Specialist Bot - ELLU Studios Fashion Design Assistant

A sophisticated Next.js chatbot specialized in providing fashion design education support for students. Originally built as a technical documentation assistant, this project demonstrates the flexibility of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture by successfully transforming from Next.js/React domain to fashion design education. Built with advanced RAG capabilities, function calling, and powered by OpenAI's GPT models.

## Project Evolution Journey

This project showcases a complete domain transformation while preserving the underlying technical architecture:

**Phase 1-2**: Technical Documentation Assistant (Next.js/React)  
**Phase 3**: Complete transformation to Fashion Design Student Assistant for ELLU Studios

The codebase demonstrates how a well-architected RAG system can be adapted to entirely different domains while maintaining all technical capabilities.
